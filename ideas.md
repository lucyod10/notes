## Machine learning



!(tensorflow posenet)[https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet], to make 3D browser tracking.

face-api.js

- face landmark detection
- facial expression detection

Game!
- train model in browser
- !(use face position to move pacman!)[https://www.tensorflow.org/js/demos/]

Idea:

- Mario style platformer where you train to make movement: run, jump, attack.
- make in 3D with renders.
