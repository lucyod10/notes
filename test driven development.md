# Test Driven Development

`gem install rspec`

then in your folder just `rpsc` to run

```
rspec --init
```

This makes a spec folder in your project. All test files go here. We made a bank.rb file, and then the test file is calles bank_spec.rb


Shows all the tests as a little summary of how the code works. You can add this to the .rspec file if you want it to print every time you run `rspec`
```
rspec --format=documentation
```

- Write a failing test
- get that test to pass, then continue.
